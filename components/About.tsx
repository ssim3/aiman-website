                Hello! I'm Aiman Roza ðŸ˜Š
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I help families turn their homes into S.A.F.E havens â€” and their
                property moves into stepping stones toward early, comfortable
                retirement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                When I was young, my family once struggled to pay our mortgage.
                I remember assisting my parents with the payments, only to see
                the balance barely reduced. That's when I realized how little
                most people truly understand about property â€” and how easily
                small mistakes can cost a lot.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                That experience stayed with me and inspired me to empower
                others. In the past 4 years, I've been fortunate to guide
                hundreds of families through Singapore's HDB and Condo market,
                helping them make smart property decisions that protect their
                family, lifestyle, and future.
              </p>
